    \note As an alternative method, it is possible to pass the
    F_CPU macro down to the compiler from the Makefile.
    Obviously, in that case, no \c \#define statement should be
    used.

    The functions in this header file are wrappers around the basic
    busy-wait functions from <util/delay_basic.h>.  They are meant as
    convenience functions where actual time values can be specified
    rather than a number of cycles to wait for.  The idea behind is
    that compile-time constant expressions will be eliminated by
    compiler optimization so floating-point expressions can be used
    to calculate the number of delay cycles needed based on the CPU
    frequency passed by the macro F_CPU.

    \note In order for these functions to work as intended, compiler
    optimizations <em>must</em> be enabled, and the delay time
    <em>must</em> be an expression that is a known constant at
    compile-time.  If these requirements are not met, the resulting
    delay will be much longer (and basically unpredictable), and
    applications that otherwise do not use floating-point calculations
    will experience severe code bloat by the floating-point library
    routines linked into the application.

    The functions available allow the specification of microsecond, and
    millisecond delays directly, using the application-supplied macro
    F_CPU as the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz).

/**
   \ingroup util_delay

   Perform a delay of \c __ms milliseconds, using _delay_loop_2().

   The macro F_CPU is supposed to be defined to a
   constant defining the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz).

   The maximal possible delay is 262.14 ms / F_CPU in MHz.

   When the user request delay which exceed the maximum possible one,
   _delay_ms() provides a decreased resolution functionality. In this
   mode _delay_ms() will work with a resolution of 1/10 ms, providing
   delays up to 6.5535 seconds (independent from CPU frequency).  The
   user will not be informed about decreased resolution.

   If the avr-gcc toolchain has __builtin_avr_delay_cycles(unsigned long)
   support, maximal possible delay is 4294967.295 ms/ F_CPU in MHz. For
   values greater than the maximal possible delay, overflows results in
   no delay i.e., 0ms.

   Conversion of __us into clock cycles may not always result in integer.
   By default, the clock cycles rounded up to next integer. This ensures that
   the user gets atleast __us microseconds of delay.

   Alternatively, user can define __DELAY_ROUND_DOWN__ and __DELAY_ROUND_CLOSEST__
   to round down and round to closest integer.

   Note: The new implementation of _delay_ms(double __ms) with 
    __builtin_avr_delay_cycles(unsigned long) support is not backward compatible. 
   User can define __DELAY_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE__ to get a backward compatible delay.
   Also, the backward compatible
   algorithm will be chosen if the code is compiled in a <em>freestanding
   environment</em> (GCC option \c -ffreestanding), as the math functions
   required for rounding are not available to the compiler then.
