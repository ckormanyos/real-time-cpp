# Example Chapter11_07a
## Preemptive Multitasking

This example makes advanced use
of preemptive multitasking scheduling with a highly detailed
and exciting calculation of the mathematical constant $\pi$
to high precision. It uses a spigot-type calculation that is also
combined with a blinky application. The $\pi$ calculation
is performed perpetually and cyclically (and also numerically verified)
in a low-priority background task.
